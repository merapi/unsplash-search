### About
Simple app for Unsplash user searching and displaying their photos

---

Todo:
- Click to open photo in a new tab
- Loading... messages
- Infinite scrolling?
- Better responsive/mobile behaviours (photos resolutions, number of columns)
- Complex state management? (We probably don't need redux here...)
